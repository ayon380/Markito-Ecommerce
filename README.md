# E-commerce Store

This is an e-commerce store built with React, Next.js, MongoDB, and Razorpay. It also has Docker support.

## Technologies

- **React** is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components¬π.
- **Next.js** is a React framework that enables developers to create full-stack web applications by extending the latest React features and integrating powerful JavaScript tooling for fast builds‚Åµ.
- **MongoDB** is a distributed database that offers a flexible document data model along with support for ad-hoc queries, secondary indexing, and real-time aggregations to provide powerful ways to access and analyze data‚Åπ.
- **Razorpay** is a payment solution in India that allows businesses to accept, process, and disburse payments with its product suite. It gives access to all payment modes including credit card, debit card, netbanking, UPI, and popular wallets¬π¬≤.
- **Docker** is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. It enables developers to separate their applications from their infrastructure so they can deliver software quickly¬π‚Å∂.

- Node.js
- MongoDB
- Docker (optional)

Once you have these installed, you can clone this repository and navigate to the project directory. Then, run the following command to install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

After the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server by running:

```
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Deployment
